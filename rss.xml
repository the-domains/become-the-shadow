            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Budo Bum</h1><p>I was reading an article about a writer who became a carpenter , but didn't stop writing, and it made me think about the mistake I sometimes see people make with budo. Budo is a Way, and as ways go, I think it is a great one.</p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QiowuZVTIK4/VRivOh0EkmI/AAAAAAAAAfc/hMGII1uAXVk/s1600/Gri%2Bphoto%2BGirl%2Bin%2Bstation%2Bwith%2Bsword%2Bbag.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Budo Bum</h1><p>I had a conversation with one of my Shinto Muso Ryu students that was interesting. He was having a common issue with a core technique. He was trying to make the technique unnecessarily complicated. The technique (in this case Maki Otoshi) is difficult enough without making it complicated. Good budo is simple.</p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Rz4WZLm-MxE/Vcty__kp7zI/AAAAAAAAAn8/uxbJbrJMBq4/s320/16359775292_fafaac2f2a_z.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Budo Bum</h1><p>I had my technique ripped to shreds by a teacher the other day. He pointed out every little mistake, and he wasn't the least bit gentle. There were no attempts to soften any criticism or to protect my ego. This was the epitome of "in your face" instruction.</p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DepeRgxJw-0/VkvGyFmr8KI/AAAAAAAAAtY/nG3N0Q7x32I/s320/15162740028_ef522e57cf_z.jpg"></article>]]></description>
