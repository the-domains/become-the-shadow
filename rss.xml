            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1></h1><p>Being on the receiving end of a technique is seen as a chore. That is too limited a view. Being uke is a growth experience if you know how.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hatsumi Sensei Expands Into A Ninpo Type Feeling</h1><p>Next week I will travel again to Japan for Bujinkan training. My 3rd time this year. That may seem excessive, but the experiences I enjoy each trip help me discover the "secrets" of our art. For example, here is a lesson from Hatsumi Sensei that taught me how to be a lucky ninja.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/afd2c9d71611a3b7deef2acfca18d058c85031ae.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Are You In The Dojo?</h1><p>I had my technique ripped to shreds by a teacher the other day. He pointed out every little mistake, and he wasn't the least bit gentle. There were no attempts to soften any criticism or to protect my ego. This was the epitome of "in your face" instruction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/52c0aec3651573c9051590936929ea259f96b5ae.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Good Budo Is Simple. That Doesn't Mean It's Easy.</h1><p>I had a conversation with one of my Shinto Muso Ryu students that was interesting. He was having a common issue with a core technique. He was trying to make the technique unnecessarily complicated. The technique (in this case Maki Otoshi) is difficult enough without making it complicated. Good budo is simple.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c3f0addf10b83019656e836cbb5d4bff5cf864a0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Budo Isn't Life</h1><p>I was reading an article about a writer who became a carpenter , but didn't stop writing, and it made me think about the mistake I sometimes see people make with budo.
