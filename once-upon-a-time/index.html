TIME</p><p>Ok so naturally you want to know a little about me and this blog, I can understand that. I was born in the early 80s and grew up like almost any kid of the 90s. I woke up early to watch cartoons in 90s and I played with GI Joes. I grew up with my father, after him and my mother got a divorce. I do not come from anything of what you could call a rich family. Heck for a large portion of my life I lived in a trailer. My father was enlisted in the US Air Force and after he retired he tried to find work where he could. He tried to become a cop till he found out, like most ex-military, that your military experience doesn’t really mean crap. From there he worked at a gas station, a prison security guard, and finally a truck driver.</p><p>I guess were my interest (read obsession) for martial arts started with like most kids of my generation was in movies and cartoons. I watched and played with ninja turtles, I loved Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee was amazing, the Karate Kid series would be watched in my house at least once a week, and the American Ninja series of movies were the coolest thing ever to be made.</p><p>My father wasn’t a huge fan of the American Ninja movies, he thought they were to bloody. Looking back on it now I think that were I grew interested in being a real ninja. Karate was cool but it wasn’t deadly and badass. My dad didn’t look at karate and think it was too extreme for me. Like many young people of the day ninjas were only thing that were from myth and legend. They only showed up on TV and movies, there was no way you could ever be one. Sure you could buy their outfits and their weapons from the back of martial arts magazines but nobody taught it. Like every other kid I thought it was something that if it did still exist it was taught my secret ninja clan in japan and would never teach a white kid from the US.</p><p>Over time my obsession grew so much that I would look at dojos in the phone book (internet was not a thing yet). I would look at all the names and ads and try to pick out which one I wanted to learn from. If you remember though me and my dad were pretty poor. So for the longest time all I could do was look through the phone book and dream. The closest thing I got to learn any type of martial arts for many years was in books. I will say one thing coping off the movies and trying to learn moves from books is no way to learn martial arts of any kind.</p><p>But one day it finally happened, my dad decided it was time for me to enroll in karate. The decision was finally made because he was tired of me being picked on in school. You could pick any number of reasons why I got beat up as a kid. I was skinny, short, poor, had a bad haircut, and a mouth that was quick to tell bullies to bring it.  So my dad picked a school and I started attending Tom Kelly’s Kempo Karate. I still remembering going to my first class. We showed up a couple of days before class, paid my dues, bought my white gi and belt, and my father was very quick to explain to Sensei Kelly that I wanted to be like Daniel-son. I was so embarrassed my face turned bright red. All he said was “Mr. Miyagi doesn’t know real karate.”</p><p>So I went to kempo for several years till the time came that we had to move to a tiny town and there was no martial arts school. From there that was pretty much the end of my budo studies till I turned nineteen and joined the army. Then in 2002 the army taught me Brazilian Jujitsu. Well I like to say they taught me the ground portion of BJJ because that’s all the army teaches are the parts were you are rolling around on the ground and grappling. The army is not really willing to teach you much else unless you want to get teased and have the instructors beat the crap out of you with fighting sticks. The army combatives program is very sadistic under the guise of preparing you to kill someone.</p><p>Fast forward several years and I am now getting ready to leave the army and that is leaving me with more time than what I am use to. So after many years of looking for dojos and many attempts to try to start to attend class I finally found a Sensei that is near me. I made this site mainly so that I had a creative outlet to express my thoughts.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="54"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="56"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="57"><span data-reactid="58"><!-- react-empty: 59 --><h2 data-reactid="60"><a data-reactid="61">Become The Shadow</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="62"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="63"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="64"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="65"></div></section></div></div>
