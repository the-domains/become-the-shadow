Ok so someone is going to ask on out of all the ninjutsu ryu out there how did I decide on the style at I would study and overall what did I end up choosing to study and how to study it.

Let's start by saying that there are a TON of different things saying that they are ninjutsu. You have Budo Ryu Ninjutsu, Dux Ryu Ninjutsu, Genbukan, Banke Shinobinden, Nindo Ryu Bujutsu Kai, To-Shin Do, and finally Bujinkan. Now with all of these styles each one has their own drama, most of it that involves internet trolls or some form of pointing fingers saying that "your styles is not real!!!!". So when I started looking at all the different styles I decided that I would try to look at each style for with an open mind. I was trying to look at each one and determine myself via authenticity, locations of dojos, online support, history, style, and cost.

One of the major things that I wanted was an actual dojo were I could train. I have learned from experience that books don't work and I am hesitant to try to train by video alone. If push came to shove I would train via a at home kit and then try to use seminars as a stop-gap. Next thing I looked at was authenticity. But let's start by saying that locations of dojos knocked out a ton styles. There are some styles that are located only in California, here, or there. Basically in a location that I am not going to be at anytime soon and I am sorry I will not move my entire family for a dojo, sorry but I am not rich.

Next came authenticity, I am sorry but even a layman can look at some of these styles and say that they are not ninjutsu in any way. Some of the schools are somewhat believable and the only real way to tell was to actually study under the school. While some of the schools you look at have a clear lineage. After this step that narrowed down the schools to I think three.

So overall I decided to study the Bujinkan, but I was in the situation that dojos are spread out all over the US almost none of them are connected with each other, there is no one site online that lists them all, some are not listed on any site, some are only spread by word of mouth, and some have instructors that less than reputable. So while I spent the next three months trying to find a physical dojo I decided that I would try to get a head start by using a video study program.

After looking at many online programs I narrowed it down to Shidan Richard Van Donks black belt home program, Stephen K. Hayes To-Shin Do online program, Budo Ryu Ninjutsu online dojo, or Shihan Mark Roemke's online dojo. All of these programs are either pure Bujinkan or based on Bujinkan. So when picking these was the big problem of cost, quality of training, and the ability to gain real ranks. My first choice was Shidan Donks program but sadly the cost of his programs are very high. $300 bucks might not be much for some people but honestly that a bit much for me to just drop on martial arts training, something that my wife doesn't really consider a priority in our life.

So after much deliberation I decided that I would go with To-Shin Do online course. Overall I am very happy with it. They have a low monthly cost, good quality videos, but no way to test for rank. As time goes on I might go through and look at another program to back this up but for now with is serving me just fine.

By time I was finished with To-Shin Do's white belt studies I found a Sensei and now have actual training partners to learn from. So until time comes we're I have extra money around I think I will stick with my Bujinkan dojo and online training in To-Shin Do.
