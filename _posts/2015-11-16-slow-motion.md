# Slow Motion

Awhile ago I got the great pleasure of attending a seminar by Shihan Mundo Ruiz Tapia. I am not going to go into long winded details about what kata we studied or anything else that you should really just be learning from your sensei, but I will say that it was a great class and I learned a lot. I say class because I picked up a nail coming home Saturday night so I couldn't return on Sunday. No this article is going to go over two major things that I learned from not the martial parts of the art themselves but what I learned from how Sensei Mundo teaches and trains.

One of the major criticism of the Bujinkan is that the training speed is and for the longest time I figured that it moves slow for beginners and to avoid injury. As a beginner though it's really easy to see that a couple inches can make all the difference in some of our techniques. I personally have one particular kata that I can never manage to get unless I go super slow and make sure that my arm gets exactly in the right spot. I can hear all the detractors now, "If you can't do it slow how could you possibly do it at combat speed!?"

Well you see at this point I am not expected to do anything at combat speed, I am still just trying to learn the forms. I shouldn't even be thinking about using anything I have learned in this art in any form of combat. I need to be concerned with just learning them right. If there is one thing that you learn from firearms training, it's muscle memory. You do something enough times your body will soon learn to do it correctly over and over without thinking about it. So as Sensei Mundo pointed out you do everything slowly in training so that you can get it without any mistakes. You take your time and do the kata correctly over and over again. In doing so you are teaching your body the correct way of moving for the forms so that when and if the time comes you can do the forms CORRECTLY at combat speed without thinking. I was frankly amazed that I never caught on to this before because it's the exact same training methodology that is used in the army today. What is the use of learning a technique if you move to fast, learn it incorrectly, and then when the time comes your Budo is completely off causing your moves to fail. You would be shooting yourself in the foot and frankly waisting your time in even trying to learn it.
