# Weapons

Up until I started practicing ninjutsu the only weapon I ever had a chance to even play with was tanbo (aka kempo sticks) and besides that all I really ever saw was stuff from movies. That's not to say that I have never wanted to learn how to use them. Who hasn't wanted to use a katana, a bo, or my favorite the sai? There is always a certain amount of elegance and beauty comes from martial arts weapons. A sense of water that comes from using a weapon as an extension of your own body.

In contrast I consider empty handed combat to feel very earthy. The two provide an interesting contrast. So much of the art has its roots grounded in a heavy earth feeling. The wide low stances, quick strikes, rigid blocks, using gravity against your enemy, and even going as far as using a enemies own earth energy (weight) against them. Then you take a weapon and the movement ties together in a different way. You don't feel the earth power you are using more of water or air, depending on the weapon.

A couple weeks back we did a class with a hanbo and let me tell you I am in love. Small weapon that is fast moving and can strike like a typhoon. I never thought that such a small thing could be used as a tool to move people, take someone out with a strike, or grab them and lock them where you want them. I now see why police forces still use them, they are a strong, versatile, and hard hitting tool. I actually carry one around in my car with me.

Fast forward another couple classes and we worked with the Bo. Bo was pretty difficult for me to get a grasp on. I have never really worked with a weapon that large before. I feel that I learned a lot with it though. For the most part after doing something three of four times normally I get it down, for the most part, and then after that I don't really have to concentrate on doing it anymore because muscle memory takes over. Now so much for me with this weapon, I had to try and think though every single movement because I kept wanting to grab it the wrong way. I can see its power and I know that with more practice I can truly start to see its potential.

Last weapon we have been working on lately has been the Sword (ie katana). This is the weapon that everyone dreams of. Every kid takes a mop handle and pretends it's a sword. I guess that I was weird because I was the only kid pretending it was a katana. I was the only one standing in On No Kamae while everyone else had broad swords in full (imaginary) plate armor. With all that aside I had never actually had a chance to learn anything with swords. The closest I ever got was samurai movies and anime. So after a couple classes of working with a bokken I can honestly say that I love it. It's simple, elegant, fluid, powerful, and crazy fun. I now see the appeal of doing things like kendo.

I can honestly say that I think weapons are really fun and powerful but my first love is still open hand. Didn't stop me from getting a full set of weapons though. I also see how weapons feed into everything else that we do in this art. Working with a bokken will help you become better with a Bo. Working with a Bo will make you better with your open hand. Working with your open hand will make you better with your hanbo. It's all a huge circle of love, pain, and badassery.
