# First Class

Well it's official after all these years of looking at videos online, books, and everything else that I can find I finally found a Sensei near me that I can learn from. I spent the entire night learning from the classes' senpai. I can say that I honestly have a ton of work and I have to try to change habits that I learned from other styles and my own bad habits. Good thing is that some of the stuff already paid off, it's a good thing that Brazilian Jujitsu teaches rolls and tucks because I spend all night using them because I got thrown around a ton. I only left with a few minor bruises and a sore armpit, considering the punishment we take in combative that's nothing. 

Part of me wishes that we were staying in this area after I leave the army because I really like the Sensei, the Senpai, and the other students. I tried to contact a Sensei by where we will be moving and so far no luck from contacting the dojo or the Sensei on Facebook. On the upside if that fails or the dojo is gone I can always drive an hour and half to train under no other than Ed Martin. 

I couldn't wait so I ended up ordering my uniform off of amazon and putting it on my amazon card. Now all I have to do is order my Kyu patch from Shihan Donk. It really does suck that those things are about thirty bucks a piece though.
