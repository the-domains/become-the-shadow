# THE ART OF UKE ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c34abf0a-f1cc-4f87-90d2-108d4da5a276.png)

Being a good uke helps your partner. And there is an art to being a good uke. Last time I talked about the importance of proper attacks. This time I am going into more detail on the ways of doing proper attacks. 

Last time, I wrote about the importance of being uke. Uke is of course the guy on the receiving end of the technique. The guy that gets all the glory is called tori in most styles now. Other traditions call the role of uke different things, but I honestly don't know any Japanese art that thinks it is unimportant. 

This time, I want to show how important it is to be a good uke for your partner. You may learn from being uke, but you also need to be the best uke you can. A little secret (well, not that secret) is that good practitioners don't mind working out with lower ranked guys as long as they are a good pair for training with. And if you read the last blog, you know how much you can learn from being on the receiving end of a good practitioner. 

Let us get to the heart of the matter. Here are two techniques, both starting from what could simply be called, "A grab to the lapel area." ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7a0f17d7-3dda-40f6-b5d7-1ba585497c9a.jpg)

Notice that I end up in different end techniques. The brighter of you might have noticed from the title of this blog that the key is not what I am doing, but what the uke was doing. Please note the arm. In one, the arm is pretty bent, in the other pretty straight. You may guess that this is a big reason I ended up doing the techniques I did. When the arm is already pretty stretched out, a move that hyper-extends the elbow is fairly easy to go into. And when the arm is bent a good deal, bending it the way I do is the easiest thing to pull off. 

I can hear some jerks starting in already, "But shouldn't we be trying for the more difficult target to train harder and be better able to overcome resistance?" No you idiots, you don't train yourself to go through a minefield when you can walk around it. 

There is actually a lot of things that you can't say are "wrong" or "right" in taijutsu. A better word might be "appropriate." 

Let me give you a real strange example of something that was totally appropriate for the situation. A friend of mine is an outlaw. Not a criminal his mind, but he has worked outside the law. He is not quite like what you see in "Sons of Anarchy", but he does scare the civilians from time to time. He once had a friend who was down in the dumps and thinking of suicide. As he talked with my friend and got deeper and deeper into a funk, my friend suddenly attacked him with near- lethal intent. The guy fought back, and by fighting for his life lost the urge to take it. I don't recommend this for suicide counselors, but it worked in this case. 

Like water, you need to conform to what you are given and not try to make the situation fit what you want to do. To practice this, you need to experience the exact situation the technique calls for. As I show above, even the angle of the arm can count in some situations. 

Of course, you probably can't get this down at first, but it really helps to try to pay attention to the exact attack the uke is doing as well as what the technique is. It is only through constant practice that your body learns what is appropriate in some situations. You don't have time to think in a real fight, so you have to train your body to feel what is going on and go for the best option in that case. Your body has been in that particular situation many times in practice, so it can recognize it when things go south. Without experiencing it a lot, you won't be able to pick up what is going on, so you need to run into that situation a lot. And for that you need a good uke. 

In reality, you just take the best option on the table. You don't choose what you will do when you are attacked. The attacker gives you the options you can take advantage of, some more than others. Masaaki Hatsumi of the Bujinkan once told a class I was in that he couldn't do the exact same technique more than twice in a row because nobody attacks him exactly the same twice in a row. At his level, he is reacting to things the rest of us can't. For me, a punch to my face might have small differences but it is still a punch and I react to them the same way. But as I advance, that will change and I have to experience the appropriate attacks to tell them apart when the response is called for. 

This is why in many styles the uke is the senior practitioner. Most people think that uke is the lower position, but in some styles the uke is so important in giving the exact attack that it usually falls onto the more senior students of teacher. And when the senior is a teacher as well, he can be more active. Kata is not a static set of moves. Maybe at first you try to just get down the sequence, and most teachers in the Bujinkan never get beyond this, but at a certain point the uke (when told by a teacher) can take a far more active role in keeping the tori on his toes. 

There is a kata from Kukishinden-ryu called Shiho-dori that most people screw up. It is a series of moves, most which aren't completed before going onto the next. As I learned it in Japan, it helps train people to not go for techniques that the other guy is resisting. As uke, you have to try to stop tori from doing the technique. Instead of trying to overcome your resistance, he flows into another technique. Without the input of the uke, the kata doesn't mean much except to train people to not go through when a technique is starting to work, or put on half assed ones so they can be abandoned. 

Sometimes we would train where the uke would sometimes resist as the kata requires, sometimes not. If it was a case of not (and honestly, most of the times I didn't resist was because I was behind the curve) then the tori did the technique and tossed you instead of going onto the next move. And no, you can't get this from sparring. Yes in sparring the other guy attacks you with intent. But he is not going to go through a full range of attacks, just the ones he is good at. You need to feel attacks from behind, chokes, etc that you may never see someone else do in a sparring match. People tend to stick to a small number of moves they are good at when they really want to fight, and you need more than just that handful of stuff. 

If you want good partners to help you with this, then you have to be a good partner yourself. I think most people reading this want to be good partners, they just haven't realized how small details like the elbow example count. So now you know, and instead of just watching the tori, watch a bit of the uke as well.
