# UNDERSTANDING "RADICAL" ISLAM

On this anniversary of 9-11, I want to take the time to encourage people to understand more about Islam and be educated enough to help those that seek to make it a peaceful religion instead of what it has become under groups such as ISIS. Let me start with a quote. I hardly doubt that today many will hear words from Muslim groups about being partners against radical members of their religion and not supporting terrorism. So I start with this section taken from pages 203- 204 of Ronald Kessler's, "Secrets of the FBI." 

_At one meeting, A Muslim group suggested having a photo taken of their members with Bob Mueller to show their community isn't a bunch of terrorists and that they are partners in the war on terrorism. (Arthur) Cummings responded, "Let me make you a suggestion: When you bring to my attention real extremests who are here to plan and do something, who are here supporting terrorism, and I work that baed on your information, then I promise you, I will have the director stand up on the stage with you." To Cummings' amazement, the answers was, "That could never happen. We would lose our constituency. We could never admit to bringing someone to the FBI." _

Kind of put things in a new light, right? Many of those that claim to speak for moderate Muslims really aren't. In fact, it has been said that the only thing an islamic group need to do to be considered moderate is to not actively preach violence. Groups like the Westboro church are considered radical christian groups because of their rejection of homosexuals, but they don't urge violence against them. Of course when ISIS tosses homosexuals off of buildings, that makes them radical muslims in the eyes of the world. But it is a fact uncovered by Greg Lukianoff in his role of defending free speech on campus is that every college muslim group he has run across has been allowed to keep homosexuals out. Think about that. A christian group that tried that would be banned for being too hateful and radical. Yet the muslim groups are allowed to follow that pattern. Think also of what kind of people run groups that fought hard to make their schools buckle under to their discrimination of homosexuals? Would you say they are not likely to encourage tolerance of other beliefs and ways of thinking? Islam needs a reformation. With this blog I hope to get the readers to go out and increase their knowledge of the reality of Islam and help those that are trying to reform it. To help, you need education. You need to know enough to not help the wolves in sheep's clothing such as the Council for American Islamic Relations (CAIR) that pretend to be moderate, but have been labeled terrorist organizations in some nations. My recomendations are two authors, Irshad Manji and Ayaan Hirsi Ali for a start.Ayaan's laters book, "Heretic" is a call to reform Islam and you might want to start there. All the books by these authors (both female BTW) would be good places. You can probably find them at your bookstore or your library. Right now, I suppose that many are going to say that they heard that they are islamaphobes and refuse to read anything by them. Let me just point out how closed minded that is. Groups like CAIR have managed to get Ayaan and Irshad bounced from TV programs, talks at universities and such by spreading such stories. And people buy it. If your first reaction is to reject the idea of reading something by them, then you have been well trained to not think for yourself by CAIR and others. Maybe it is time you challenge your beliefs and take a trip to your library. You may think you know about islam and the groups that represent it in the states because you have watched the news. Let me ask if you know this bit taken from Ayaan's new book. In her book, she breaks down muslims into three groups. The smallest is the reformers. The largest is what she calls the Mecca muslims. They are fairly stable, non-violent types. In between the two groups in terms of size is the Medina muslims. They are the violent, intolerant ones. Why these names? Well, at first Muhammed set up in Mecca where his group was a very small minority among a lot of different faiths. There were even jews and early christians there, whom he tried to recruit by coming up with the story that he was the latest in a line of prophets. They rejected him and he ended up taking his group to Medina, where all the statements he made about other faiths, and christianity and judaism in particular, was very negative and rather violent. This is relevant to your education in that islam has a tradition of considering later statements in the Koran as trumping earlier ones. The reasoning is, the more experience Mohammed had, the more accurate what he said was. It actually makes sense. But the upshot is that all the things you have heard quoted in the Koran about being nice and tolerant pretty much come from his time in Mecca and are not as important as what he later said about things like how there can be no heaven on earth until all the jews are dead. That knowledge scares me, and it should scare you. I don't know if they will succeed in their quest to reform islam like christianity was centuries ago. It seems to me that the deck is stacked against them by the foundation of islam by Mohammed. It is true that any religion can be perverted, but let's be honest and admit that there really aren't many cases of a nation being invaded, its women raped and its people forced to convert to buddhism. There are pedophiles hiding in the shadows of every religion, but you can find men decades older marrying 9 year old girls in Yeman and even in secret in some places like Europe. They have the justification that since Mohammed marred Aisha and had sex with her at age 9, then it is ok for everyone else. Of course, Mohammed also led raids against caravans, slaughtered unarmed prisoners, took slaves, allowed his men to rape captured prisoners and slaves and praised men who killed his critics. It seems a tough sell to tell people that what the man they think is without sin did is somehow wrong for others to do. 

But we have to help those that are making the effort. They can't do it on their own. And a lot of what we do is helping the extremists. The example of the college clubs is an example. We should not tolerate groups operating on taxpayer funded institutions to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation. We might not be fighting in the mosques, but we can at least shut down one way they are spreading their brand of hate. Irshad Manji is openly lesbian and has a small group devoted to an islam that loves all, including her sexual orientation. She says that none of the major groups that claim to speak for muslims will accept her group. Doesn't that show that their talk of tolerance for other ways of thinking and doing things is a bunch of bull? You really can't get the whole picture from just a blog. Please, go out and get some of the books by these authors and find out what groups like CAIR don't want you to. Challenge what Manji and Ayaan write. They would want that. But don't refuse to listen to their words. That is a tactic of those opposed to democracy and free speech.
