# A Ninjutsu handbook that actually helps!

Now I have expressed it before and I will more than likely express it again, I do not like trying to learn martial arts from a book. It is so easy look at something and then think you know what the move or kata is and you end up missing a very important part. Over the years I have met several so called library martial arts masters. Oh they studied from this book and that book and they have practice so much, but when it really comes down to it they have no idea what they are doing. That doesn't really stop people in this day and age anymore. Many people take no pride in what they do, they just want a title of black belt or master, but that's a topic for another time.

With all that said this book made me understand something, that if a book is done right it can be a great tool for learning a martial art. Mind you I said tool, not guide. Even as good as this book is I still wouldn't want to try and learn from it alone. With that said this book is the best I have seen for any martial arts books.

No black and white photos that are hard to tell what is going on. The type doesn't look like it's the 30th copy off of a Xerox machine. All the photos are in color and take up most the almost every page. Every move and kata looks like it was taken with a high speed camera and they went through and took out the best stills. As you go along there are small text portions that explain small details of what you should be doing. These are the items that you normally miss with the old martial arts books.

It's not just the quality of the book that makes it worth it, it is also the info that it contains. If you look at many ninjutsu and Bujinkan books you will quickly realize small things like the fact that a ton of them will list the 9 schools of the Bujinkan but not many of them explain what the schools teach. This book also has information on many aspects of Bujinkan that are missed by many dojos, books, and courses. So few of our resources go into talking anything about stealth, medicine, climbing, etc. You know the skills that played 95% of a Shinobi No Mono actual job. Last thing I will say about the content is that most the time you have to buy a book about empty hand fighting, then you would have to get another book for a type of weapon, and then another book for another type of weapon. This book covers the basics of almost every Bujinkan style.

So to sum up this book is great for beginners like myself as a reference. I have already used it while practicing a topic we covered in class. How did that kata go again? I'll just look it up in the book. What was that stance called? I'll look it up in the book. Hell I used it to figure out how to spell a Japanese word using English letters. Don't try to learn everything from it, use it like a text book, you reference from it. Twenty bucks well spent.
