# The long road

Alright so at last class something dawned on me, I have a very long road ahead. I came into this thinking that "Oh hell I did other forms of martial arts this won't be that hard." Holy shit was I wrong. I have to relearn how to move, when to move, and in which direction to move in. I step in when I should step out, I try to use muscle when I should be trying to just move my body, and in general I just tend to move in the direction that is wrong. Most of it comes from muscle memory, year after year of knowing that I need to move like this and now I need to move like that.

I think most of it stems from knowing styles that rely on muscle power. Things like hit hard, kick harder, and get in close and take them down. Now it's about taking their balance, use them against themselves, and doing as much damage as possible with using as little energy as possible. I am not used to having to go so slow to try and catch on to everything. It can be frustrating to not catch on to things like you are use to.

I don't want any of you to take this as demotivated at all. If anything it makes me more motivated. I want to see more and understand better, if I could I would train every day. I know that's not really possible I can try and shadow box off of videos but that's not the same as learning in a dojo. For now, I will have to take it slow and learn everything that I can when I can.
