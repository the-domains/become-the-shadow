**Seeking the true teachings of the Ninja Master**

I have been reading many books lately. Not all of them are from the bujinkan, but most of them pertain to martial arts or Japanese history in some way. But I finished reading one book and then started reading another and what they both said connected and kind of inspired me to make this article.

The book that I just finished reading was The Grandmasters Book of Ninja Training by Soke Masaaki Hatsumi sensei. This book is a collection of interviews that Soke made to mostly non-Japanese higher grade don ranks such as Doron Navon, Jack Hoban, and Charles Daniels. This book is basically a transcription of a conversation that the don's had with Soke and asked him questions about ninjutsu and the Bujinkan. Soke said "_... I have told you all not to take any notes while you are practicing. Even if you did, it would be of no use: if you write something down, you'll actually lose the sense of what I'm trying to teach._" Now this statement went against what has been told to me before. I have always been taught that if you want to remember something you need to makes notes of it so that you can remember it. Soke went on to say "_...what really needs to be learned is the feeling, the aspect that has no form or shape._"

So were this really struck me was the next book I started reading, which is a collection of letters that were written by Takuan Sōhō, who was a Buddhist monk of a early sect of Zen Buddhism in late 1600 and early 1700 century. When he first started off he was rather controversial and not well liked. He was accepted and later rather popular in life after he became the friend, confidant, and advisor to Yagyū Sekishusai Muneyoshi who was the leader of the Yagyū Shinkage-ryū of swordsmanship. In his first letter, The Mysterious Record of Immovable Wisdom, stated "_To speak in terms of your own martial art, when you first notice the sword that is moving to strike you, if you think of meeting that sword just as it is, your mind will stop at the sword in just that position, your own movements will be undone, and you will be cut down by your opponent. This is what stopping means._" Later in the letter he states "_If ten men, each with a sword, come at you with swords slashing, if you parry each sword without stopping the mind at each action, and go from one to the next, you will not be lacking in a proper action for every one of the ten. Although the mind act ten times against ten men, if it does not halt at even one of them and you react to one after another, will proper action be lacking? But if the mind stops before one of these men, though you parry his striking sword, when the next man comes, the right action will have slipped away._"

Later on in the letter I think he explains a little better by saying "_If one puts his mind in the action of his opponent's body, his mind will be taken by the action of his opponent's body. If he puts his mind in his opponent's sword, his mind will be taken by that sword. If he puts his mind in thoughts of his opponent's intention to strike him, his mind will be taken by thoughts of his opponent's intention to strike him. If he puts his mind in his own sword, his mind will be taken by his own sword. If he puts his mind in his own intention of not being struck, his mind will be taken by his intention of not being struck. If he puts his mind in the other man's stance, his mind will be taken by the other man's stance._" So on this train of thought; If one puts his mind in his notes, his mind will be taken by his notes.

Now some people may take this very much out of context and say that I am saying that our forms are not important. This couldn't be farther from the truth. Our forms, or kata, are vitally important. If the feeling of ninjutsu is water than the kata is the glass that holds it. Kata is the way in which you move the feeling of ninjutsu into your body. So if you are trying to gather the feeling of ninjutsu that Soke is trying to teach you, it is not important to try and remember and write down every movement of a kata, for if one puts his mind in his notes, his mind will be taken by his notes. Empty yourself, have a no mind, and gather the feeling of ninjutsu that the Grandmaster is trying to give to you. Use the kata as it was intended, as a tool to teach you the true lesson. Not something that you must take copious amounts of notes on.
