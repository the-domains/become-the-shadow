# A sparring partner with no mind

aka To find a dummy

Ok so I have been looking into a way to practice kata at home. The major problem that I ran into that so many of Bujinkans forms involve a joint lock and then taking your opponent to the ground. So that means that I need something that can be thrown around and I need something with arms. On top of all that the joints need to be able to lock.

So for this I toyed with a couple ideas so far. I first looked into a grappling dummy, but majority of those are only meant for BJJ and only one or two actually stand by themselves. When I was looking at those they cost a ton of money and most of them have arms that are basically stuffed and will flop around. The major problem is getting them to stay standing and then release when I throw them. So I was looking into some kind quick release system. Basically it adds up to a ton of money.

Next thing I looked at was heavy bags. Most of them are have to be hung and then cannot be thrown. So that leaves free standing bags. There are a couple that can be taken down but I did find one new type of bag that is made by Century that is free standing, can be tossed around, also can be used for striking. So that solves the problem of something to hit, all I need now is some way to have arms for it. So after looking around for longer than I am willing to admit I found a set of arms.
