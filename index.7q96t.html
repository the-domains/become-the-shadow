Bo was pretty difficult for me to get a grasp on. I have never really worked with a weapon that large before. I feel that I learned a lot with it though. For the most part after doing something three of four times normally I get it down, for the most part, and then after that I don’t really have to concentrate on doing it anymore because muscle memory takes over. Now so much for me with this weapon, I had to try and think though every single movement because I kept wanting to grab it the wrong way. I can see its power and I know that with more practice I can truly start to see its potential."},{"id":"f9509790-a05f-4995-8d66-257a867b1bc3","item":"7cce2959-7b94-42d5-bc97-851e46792a7a","type":"image","html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220\">\n</picture>\n","created_at":"2015-11-16T23:27:59.942Z","updated_at":"2015-11-16T23:28:18.146Z","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"keywords":[]},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/218323f4-e559-4f30-8bca-282b43c7e972.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg","pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/4a44e62d237c2bbbeef6f9a8d2868c7d/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fd1ccc9a1aaef15ca9d7a0922a0ad3357fa3dd9bc.jpg&width=220"}],"ratio":"110:179","aspect":0.6145251396648045,"orientation":"portrait","width":220,"height":358,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"faces":[{"x":90,"y":112,"width":33,"height":33,"confidence":5.003351}],"colors":[[2,0,13],[246,241,177],[96,93,110],[61,48,14],[146,141,50]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[1,18],[219,331]],"confidence":0.241342,"center":[114,167],"radius":175.241},"exif":{}}},{"id":"ab433459-d136-45c2-a531-b0d4d96500b9","item":"7cce2959-7b94-42d5-bc97-851e46792a7a","type":"text","html":"<p>Last weapon we have been working on lately has been the Sword (ie katana).
