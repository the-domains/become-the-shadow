<p>Up until I started practicing ninjutsu the only weapon I ever had a chance to even play with was tanbo (aka kempo sticks) and besides that all I really ever saw was stuff from movies. That’s not to say that I have never wanted to learn how to use them. Who hasn’t wanted to use a katana, a bo, or my favorite the sai? There is always a certain amount of elegance and beauty comes from martial arts weapons. A sense of water that comes from using a weapon as an extension of your own body.</p><picture>

<p>In contrast I consider empty handed combat to feel very earthy. The two provide an interesting contrast. So much of the art has its roots grounded in a heavy earth feeling. The wide low stances, quick strikes, rigid blocks, using gravity against your enemy, and even going as far as using a enemies own earth energy (weight) against them. Then you take a weapon and the movement ties together in a different way. You don’t feel the earth power you are using more of water or air, depending on the weapon.</p><picture>

<p>A couple weeks back we did a class with a hanbo and let me tell you I am in love. Small weapon that is fast moving and can strike like a typhoon. I never thought that such a small thing could be used as a tool to move people, take someone out with a strike, or grab them and lock them where you want them. I now see why police forces still use them, they are a strong, versatile, and hard hitting tool. I actually carry one around in my car with me.</p><picture>

<p>Fast forward another couple classes and we worked with the Bo. Bo was pretty difficult for me to get a grasp on. I have never really worked with a weapon that large before. I feel that I learned a lot with it though. For the most part after doing something three of four times normally I get it down, for the most part, and then after that I don’t really have to concentrate on doing it anymore because muscle memory takes over. Now so much for me with this weapon, I had to try and think though every single movement because I kept wanting to grab it the wrong way. I can see its power and I know that with more practice I can truly start to see its potential.</p><picture>

<p>Last weapon we have been working on lately has been the Sword (ie katana). This is the weapon that everyone dreams of. Every kid takes a mop handle and pretends it’s a sword. I guess that I was weird because I was the only kid pretending it was a katana. I was the only one standing in On No Kamae while everyone else had broad swords in full (imaginary) plate armor. With all that aside I had never actually had a chance to learn anything with swords. The closest I ever got was samurai movies and anime. So after a couple classes of working with a bokken I can honestly say that I love it. It’s simple, elegant, fluid, powerful, and crazy fun. I now see the appeal of doing things like kendo.</p><picture>

<p>I can honestly say that I think weapons are really fun and powerful but my first love is still open hand. Didn’t stop me from getting a full set of weapons though. I also see how weapons feed into everything else that we do in this art. Working with a bokken will help you become better with a Bo. Working with a Bo will make you better with your open hand. Working with your open hand will make you better with your hanbo. It’s all a huge circle of love, pain, and badassery. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="32"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="34"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="35"><span data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --><h2 data-reactid="38"><a data-reactid="39">Weapons</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="42"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="43"></div></section></div></div>
